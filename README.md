# Solvers using the DWave Quantum Annealing Computer

## Example 1 - Solving the Goat-Cabbage-Wolf problem using CQM

This is a nice little problem for the Quantum Annealer to solve using CQM.

It demonstrates how one can solve a problem by expressing the valid possible moves without giving any hints as to how to actually solver the problem.

There are two version files:
1) Colab Notebook. Ensure that you setup your API token where indicated before executing.
2) Python file you can run on DWave leap directly using : https://ide.dwavesys.io/#https://github.com/q-zee/DWave under the GCW folder.
