        "#### by Mario Guzzi - QuzziCode@gmail.com\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Riddle [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem)\n",
        "\n",
        "Once upon a time a farmer went to a market and purchased a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. On his way home, the farmer came to the bank of a river and rented a boat. But crossing the river by boat, the farmer could carry only himself and a single one of his purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage.\n",
        "\n",
        "If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage.\n",
        "\n",
        "The farmer's challenge was to carry himself and his purchases to the far bank of the river, leaving each purchase intact. How did he do it? \n",
        "\n",
        "## Solving with the Quantum Computer\n",
        "\n",
        "We want to let the Quantum Computer figure out how to solve this puzzle without giving any hints in our coding as to how to solve it: Just provide a construct describing the possible moves the farmer can physically make, the dangers (undesirable) situations to avoid and a way to know that the problem is solved efficiently (objective).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Method: We use DWave Constraint Quadratic Model Hybrid (CQM) Quantum Annealer\n",
        "\n",
        "### Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "We are using CQM to solve this problem. We define 4 binary variables representing each object and the river bank they are on:\n",
        "\n",
        ">Wolf, Goat, Cabbage and the Farmer\n",
        "\n",
        ">0 = Left bank, 1 = Right bank\n",
        "\n",
        "As well each of these variables are assigned a step (boat trip). This forms a grid of 4 variables in N steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore we add 2 sets of binary variables, each indicating the \"available\" items to move to the opposite bank and the \"choice\" made out of these available items. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Visualization\n",
        "\n",
        "The table below details the model. Each row represents a current state and a trip decision: Which of the cargo items can be moved and which one has been selected for the trip.\n",
        "\n",
        "F is the farmer and while the farmer is on a bank the cargo is safe. Where the farmer is absent, the cargo needs to be safe from the dangers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first row in the table below shows that the Goat was selected to be moved from the left bank to the right bank (row 2) leaving the wolf and cabbage behind (a valid condition).\n",
        "\n",
        "The last row shows the final goal everyone is on the other side.\n",
